# ElecTech-Sales-Analysis - Project Overview


## **The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into the sales performance of a e-commerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data such as revenue, customer behaviour and product-level performance, we aim to identify patterns, implement effective solutions and produce data-driven recommendations for its marketing and sales teams.**

## Project Background

Founded in June 2023, ElecTech is an e-commerce company specializing in high-tech products and serving customers across Europe. In September 2023, the company launched its first website platform/marketplace, enabling customers to buy products directly.
Now that a year has passed since the platform's launch, the sales and marketing teams have engaged our expertise as data analysts to leverage data collected over the past year. The analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of sales performance across product types and customer segments, and to support impactful decision-making for strategy development.

**In order to evaluate sales performance, we focused our insights and recommendations on the following key metrics:**

* **Sales Trend Analysis**: Assessment of sales patterns by product and customer, focusing on Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), and Order Volume.
* **Product-Level Performance**: In-depth analysis of product trends during the period to understand their impact on sales.
* **Customer Segmentation**: Evaluation of customer behavior by age range and loyalty membership.

The following sections will explore additional factors and highlight key areas for improvement.

## Key Insights

### Sales Trends:

Overall, ElecTech experienced a very encouraging first year based on key performance indicators (KPIs): Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), and Order Count. Key Metrics Results for September 2023 vs. September 2024: Revenue: +945% | Order Volume: +685% | AOV: +33% (September 2024 compared to September 2023).

After a modest increase in the first two months, the tech company saw an impressive spike in January across all metrics. During this period, the company’s order count peaked in January 2024 with a total of 2,049 orders, generating sales revenue of $6,620,172 compared to $1,980,700 in the previous month. The French winter sales period likely contributed to this impressive increase, which helped boost brand awareness among customers.

After maintaining steady performance over eight consecutive months, Order Volume and Revenue began to decline in August through the end of the period. Meanwhile, the AOV metric continued to increase, revealing commercial opportunities for the company.
