# ElecTech-Sales-Analysis - Project Overview


## **The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into the sales performance of a commerce company over the pas year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data such as revenue, customer behaviour and product-level performance, we aim to identify patterns, implement effective solutions and produce data-driven recommendations for its marketing and sales teams.**

## Project Background

Founded in 2021, ElecTech is an e-commerce company specializing in high-tech products and serving customers across Europe. In 2023, the company launched its first website platform/marketplace, enabling customers to buy products directly.
Now that a year has passed since the platform's launch, the sales and marketing teams have engaged our expertise as data analysts to leverage data collected over the past year. The analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of sales performance across product types and customer segments, and to support impactful decision-making for strategy development.

**In order to evaluate sales performance, we focused our insights and recommendations on the following key metrics:**

* **Sales Trend Analysis**: Assessment of sales patterns by product and customer, focusing on Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), and Order Volume.
* **Product-Level Performance**: In-depth analysis of product trends during the period to understand their impact on sales.
* **Customer Segmentation**: Evaluation of customer behavior by age range and loyalty membership.

## Executive Summary
After a modest start, ElecTech saw an impressive increase in January, as confirmed by KPI, which all showed strong  growth: Revenue +234%, Order Count +156%, and AOV +30%. This performance is likely attributed to the winter sales period. 
The company encountered its first significant decline in August, with both Revenue and Order Count metrics dropping by around 25% compared to July, while Average Order Value continued its upward trend through September 2024.
