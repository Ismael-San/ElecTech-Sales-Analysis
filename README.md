# ElecTech-Sales-Analysis - Project Overview


## **The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights into the sales performance of a e-commerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data such as revenue, customer behaviour and product-level performance, we aim to identify patterns, implement effective solutions and produce data-driven recommendations for its marketing and sales teams.**

## Project Background

Founded in June 2023, ElecTech is an e-commerce company specializing in high-tech products and serving customers across Europe. In September 2023, the company launched its first website platform/marketplace, enabling customers to buy products directly.
Now that a year has passed since the platform's launch, the sales and marketing teams have engaged our expertise as data analysts to leverage data collected over the past year. The analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of sales performance across product types and customer segments, and to support impactful decision-making for strategy development.

**In order to evaluate sales performance, we focused our insights and recommendations on the following key metrics:**

* **Sales Trend Analysis**: Assessment of sales patterns by product and customer, focusing on Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), and Order Volume.
* **Product-Level Performance**: In-depth analysis of product trends during the period to understand their impact on sales.
* **Customer Segmentation**: Evaluation of customer behavior by age range and loyalty membership.

## Executive Summary
ElectTech witnessed an impressive sales increase in January, as confirmed by key metrics used, all of which showed strong growth: Revenue +234%, Order Count +156%, AOV +30%. This performance is likely attributed to the winter sales period.
Driven by smartphones as the most popular product, contributing 34% of revenue, the analysis highlighted the 60+ years range as the largest customer segment (34% of total customers), generating $14M of total revenue over the period.
The analysis also revealed opportunities for ElecTech to benefit from expanding its top product lines, optimising bundling strategies, and fostering loyalty programs to decrease cancelled orders (33% of total orders). Additionally help the company recover from the decline in order value and revenue experienced since August.

## Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:



Introduce new cross-selling and upselling strategies 
* **Present complementary products and incentivizing add-ons** during customer purchases. 
* **Focus marketing efforts** on the most popular, higher-cost products, such as smartphones, and on customer segments like 60+ age range.
* **Create free shipping offers on orders that meet a certain threshold and encourage purchases**
This can help reduce stock of less popular items, such as headphones (10% of total orders), appeal to customers’ interest in add-ons, and leverage the high AOV (Average Order Value) growth phase to boost both Orders and Revenue



Foster high-value customer and loyalty program
* **Target the most frequent and high-value customers based on past order data** with tailored offers can help increase membership - Only 22% of total orders were placed by loyalty members.  
* **Enhance marketing efforts by promoting membership benefits, such as exclusive discounts, loyalty points, and a rewards system**, to foster a strong sense of loyalty among customers.



Investigate the causes of canceled orders and reduce their frequency
* **Highlight inventory levels** on product pages to create urgency and encourage purchases.
* **Implement abandoned cart notifications, such as pop-ups or reminder emails,** to alert customers when they are close to losing their cart and help prevent abandonment.
* **Examine other potential factors**, including inventory shortages or logistics and delivery issues.



Assess the origin of the impressive increase seen in January
* **Analyzing the marketing efforts/strategies** used during that time to determine ways to capitalize on them but also
conducting a customer survey to understand how customers discovered the ElecTech brand.
The goal is to avoid a 'first-year effect' and identify seasonal trends to optimize marketing efforts and boost future revenue by:
